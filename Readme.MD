## Issues

We are actively working to improve your experience with the Mausam Weather App. Here are a couple of issues we're addressing:

- **Loading Screen Glitch**: Occasionally, the loading screen displays a blank page for a few seconds during initial weather screen loading. This behavior might vary based on the client's device and internet connection.

- **Back Functionality**: We are enhancing the back functionality from the weather page to the welcome page (also known as the settings page) for smoother navigation.
